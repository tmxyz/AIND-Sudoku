# Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
## Introductory Project: Diagonal Sudoku Solver

# Question 1 (Naked Twins)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the naked twins problem?  
A: In the naked twins problem constain propagation allows us to eliminate some possible values from the boxes in a unit if in this unit there are two other boxes, which have only two possible values and these possible values are identical. This is because we know that these two values must be in these two boxes and so they cannot be in any other box in this unit.

# Question 2 (Diagonal Sudoku)
Q: How do we use constraint propagation to solve the diagonal sudoku problem?  
A: The diagonal sudoku adds additional constain to the set of constains used in the normal sudoku. In the diagonal sudoku the diagonal units must satisfy the same conditions as the rows, columns and squares - they must have all values from 1 to 9 and no values can apear more than once. This means that we can use constain propagation to eliminate some additional possible values. To do that we can use eliminate, only choice, naked twins and other strategies on the diagonal units.

### Install

This project requires **Python 3**.

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 
Please try using the environment we provided in the Anaconda lesson of the Nanodegree.

##### Optional: Pygame

Optionally, you can also install pygame if you want to see your visualization. If you've followed our instructions for setting up our conda environment, you should be all set.

If not, please see how to download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Code

* `solution.py` - Fill in the required functions in this file to complete the project.
* `test_solution.py` - You can test your solution by running `python -m unittest`.
* `PySudoku.py` - This is code for visualizing your solution.
* `visualize.py` - This is code for visualizing your solution.

### Visualizing

To visualize your solution, please only assign values to the values_dict using the `assign_value` function provided in solution.py

### Submission
Before submitting your solution to a reviewer, you are required to submit your project to Udacity's Project Assistant, which will provide some initial feedback.  

The setup is simple.  If you have not installed the client tool already, then you may do so with the command `pip install udacity-pa`.  

To submit your code to the project assistant, run `udacity submit` from within the top-level directory of this project.  You will be prompted for a username and password.  If you login using google or facebook, visit [this link](https://project-assistant.udacity.com/auth_tokens/jwt_login) for alternate login instructions.

This process will create a zipfile in your top-level directory named sudoku-<id>.zip.  This is the file that you should submit to the Udacity reviews system.
